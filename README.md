# isybau2interlis
XML Stylesheet Transformation configuration to convert Geman ISYBAU format to Swiss VSA-DSS Mini Interlis 2 Model.

# Useage
Use either the XSLX stylesheet in an application, or convert using the webpage_example.html

This is currently in development. Please feel free to contact me regarding contribution/issues/improvements.

# Limits
Currently only the sewerage infrastructure data (Stammdaten) data group is supported.
Data not covered in the target model structure is not converted.

# Issues
See the ToDo comments in the code. This is very much an initial attempt.

# Outlook
Future work could include conversions to other swiss VSA/SIA models. 
In the meantime, the swiss VSA offer a 
[conversion service](https://vsa.ch/fachbereiche-cc/siedlungsentwaesserung/generelle-entwaesserungsplanung/datenmanagement/) 
between different VSA and SIA models. 

Inclusion of other ISYBAU data groups, including hydraulic and record of condition

Conversion of swiss VSA-DSS to ISYBAU (other direction).
